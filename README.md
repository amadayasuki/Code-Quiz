# Web APIs Challenge: Code Quiz
Description: This weekâ€™s Challenge invites you to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.

### Acceptance Criteria 
I was tasked to ensure the following:

1. When a player clicks the start button a timer starts and they are presented with a question.
2. When the player answers the question, then a nother question will be asked
3. If the player answers incorrectly then time is subtracted from the timer
4. When the player answers all the questions or if the timer reaches 0 then the game is over
5. The player can save their initials and score when the game is over
